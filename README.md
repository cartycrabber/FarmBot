# FarmBot

A Minecraft mod that, when enabled, would start harvesting and replanting crops. It uses data about the surrounding blocks to dynamically cover an arbitrarily shaped/sized field. Also had an inventory management system, allowing it to grab more seeds or drop off crops when needed.

This was one of my early programming projects, before I had any understanding of objects. Thus, everything was smushed into one big class.
